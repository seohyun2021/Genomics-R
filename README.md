# genomic-R

I've done this to sum up JHU "genomic data science" in Coursera.

In my point of view, R is very powerful tool for students who want to understand genomic data in statistical way and it can save time for pratical research.  

1. RNA-seq.rmd
2. DNA-methylation.rmd
3. RNA-align-intro.rmd

If someone is interested in more examples and teaching materials, there are some free courses on the web.
