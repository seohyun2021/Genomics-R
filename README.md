# genomic-R

I've done this to summarize JHU "genomic data science" in Coursera.

In my point of view, R is a very powerful tool for students who want to understand genomic data in statistical way. I want to share what I've learned from the course and self-study with people who are interested in genomics. 

1. RNA-Count1.rmd
2. DNA-Methylation-Level.rmd
3. RNA-Count2.rmd
4. miRNA.rmd (on plan)
5. RNA-Align1.rmd (on plan)

I appreciate below free on-line courses which I've studied genomics. 

- www.coursera.org
- www.edx.org
- lagunita.stanford.edu

Hopely, it can be helpful for people who are interesed in genomics.

Have a fun!!!!!
