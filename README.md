# genomic-R

I've done this to summarize JHU "genomic data science" in Coursera.



In my point of view, R is a very powerful tool for students like me who want to understand genomic data in statistical way. I want to share what I've learned from the course and self-study with people who are interested in genomics. 

1. DNA-Methylation-Level.rmd
2. RNA-Count1.rmd
3. RNA-Count2.rmd
4. RNA-Count3.rmd (on plan)
5. RNA-Align1.rmd (on plan)
6. Gut-Microbiom1.rmd(on plan)


*** Exiqon_normalization_miRNA-FFPE.Rmd -> miRNA analysis R code. It is well coded with the paper and I like to use it for self-study. 

*** mtDNA.rmd -> I just want to say that Mitochondria is a major component in the cell, even though I don't put anything about it on 
                the site. 



I appreciate below free on-line courses which I've studied genomics. 

- www.coursera.org
- www.edx.org
- lagunita.stanford.edu



Hopely, it can be helpful for people who are interesed in genomics.

Have a fun!!!!!
