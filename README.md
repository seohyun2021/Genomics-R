# genomic-R

I've done this to summarize JHU "genomic data science" in Coursera.

In my point of view, R is a very powerful tool for students who want to understand genomic data in statistical way and it can save a lot of time for people to focus on other important works in the lab.  

1. RNA-seq.rmd
2. DNA-methylation.rmd
3. RNA-align-intro.rmd

If someone is interested in more examples and courses related with genomics, there are some (free) courses on the web.
